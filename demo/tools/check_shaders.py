"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means the two copies have drifted.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/plugin.js` holds the GLSL of `source/Shaders.cpp`. That is two copies of
the same text, and two copies drift -- quietly, because a demo that renders a
*plausible* pattern editor looks exactly like a demo that renders the right one. The
whole claim of the page is that it runs the plugin's own shader rather than
something reimplemented to look similar, so the claim needs something enforcing
it. Nothing else can: `pntest` drives the real plugin class and has no idea the
page exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

`kFragmentShader` is TWO adjacent raw strings in the C++, because MSVC caps one
string literal at about 16 KB (C2026) and the fragment shader here is well under it and split anyway so the join is exercised. The
page carries them as two constants, `FRAGMENT_SHADER_A` and `FRAGMENT_SHADER_B`,
and joins them the way the C++ compiler joins adjacent literals -- with nothing
between. So this compares:

  * every raw string, one against one, exactly -- no whitespace normalisation,
    no comment stripping, because the comments in Shaders.cpp carry the
    reasoning (why the pixel-to-cell step is integer division, what uFrac is for);
  * the joined fragment text against the joined C++ text, so a split moved from
    one place to another is still caught;
  * that the C++ fragment shader is still exactly two raw strings -- if a third
    appears, the page's two constants cannot be the whole shader and this fails
    rather than comparing a prefix;
  * that plugin.js still joins the two with `FRAGMENT_SHADER_A + FRAGMENT_SHADER_B`.

The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation. A comment in the shader
quotes `origin` in backticks, and a backtick cannot appear raw inside a
JavaScript template literal, so `plugin.js` escapes it as \\`. This unescapes
that and *rejects any other backslash on the JS side* -- there are none anywhere
in the C++, so a second escape could only be somebody hiding a difference. A
`${` would be interpolated by JavaScript, so it is rejected too.
